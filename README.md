# Wortschatz — Moin, Deutsch!

A German flashcard app: single page, no build step, installable on your phone, works offline.



## Use it everywhere

- **Install as an app**: the site is a PWA — on Android/Chrome use *Add to Home Screen / Install*,
  on iOS Safari use *Share → Add to Home Screen*. It launches standalone with its own icon.
- **Offline**: a service worker caches the app; your words are stored in `localStorage` on the device.
- **Responsive**: layouts for small phones (320 px+), notched screens (safe areas), landscape, tablet and desktop.

> Words are stored in the browser (localStorage) and can additionally sync between devices with an account — see below.

## Accounts & sync

The app has built-in accounts ("Konto & Sync" via the cloud button in the header): register once, log in on each device, and your words plus the full learning progress sync automatically — the deck is pulled when the app opens and pushed ~1.5 s after every change; the newest state wins.

You stay logged in via a secure (`HttpOnly`) session cookie that renews itself for 90 days on every visit — even if the browser clears local storage, the app logs itself back in and restores the deck from the server.

## Features

- **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — the Anki-style algorithm: four grades (Nochmal / Schwer / Gut / Leicht) with the projected interval shown on each button, learning steps for new cards (1/10 min), growing review intervals (interval × per-card ease factor, with fuzz), and lapse handling (failed reviews drop into relearning with a reduced interval and ease). Decks from the previous Leitner version migrate automatically with progress preserved
- **Topics with deck states** — toggle categories on/off with the chips above the card deck; every chip carries a mini progress bar (green = learned & in repetition, amber = currently learning, grey = untouched), a ✓ once no new words remain, and the exact breakdown as a tooltip
- **Rounds ("Pro Runde")** — practice in chunks of 5 / 10 / 15 / 25 cards instead of everything at once; the done screen shows how many cards are still due and starts the next chunk
- **Smart round composition ("Modus")** — rounds are dealt deterministically, not randomly: overdue reviews first, then cards in learning, then new words in book order; words you finished this sitting don't repeat in the next rounds; the counter shows the mix ("3 fällig + 7 neu"); switch the mode to Mix / Neue / Fällige
- **Learn state for new words** — cards you have never studied are presented first (word, translation, example and note all visible) before they get quizzed later in the same round; "Kenn ich schon" skips a known word straight to a 4-day interval
- **Repeat & drill** — "Diese Runde wiederholen" runs the same words again as an ungraded practice round (your schedule stays untouched); in the word list, "Auswählen" lets you hand-pick any words and start them as a real learning round or a drill
- **Unlimited words & own decks** — add your own words in the *+ Neu* tab, and create your own categories with the dashed *+ Thema* chip (empty decks persist, sync with your account, and can be removed again via their ×)
- **AI assist** — type just the German word and the AI fills in the article, translation, example sentence (with English translation) and a grammar note
- **Translation language (🌐, top right)** — not every German learner knows English: pick Türkçe, Azərbaycanca, Русский or a European language (Español, Français, Italiano, Português, Polski, Українська, Nederlands, Ελληνικά, Čeština, Română, Magyar, Svenska) and card backs, presentations and word details show meanings and example translations in that language (English stays as a small secondary line in details). Translations are generated in one batched AI call per round via `api/ai.js` and cached on the device; without the AI server the app simply falls back to English
- **Example translations** — cards with an example sentence show its English translation right below it
- **Browse decks & word details** — the word list filters by deck (chip row on top) and combines with search; tapping a word unfolds its full record: learning status with next review, color-coded article, example sentence with translation, tip and deck — plus controls to reset it to new, mark it as learned, or edit it
- **Streak & daily goal** — a slim strip above the deck shows your 🔥 day streak (any day with at least one graded card keeps it alive), a daily-goal ring (tap to cycle 10/20/30/50 cards) with a confetti moment when you reach it, and your 🏆 record streak; all of it syncs with your account

## Built-in categories

| Category | Cards | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Meine Wörter | 9 | starter words |
| Adjektive | 16 | common adjectives |
| Präpositionen | 14 | prepositions with case notes |
| Sätze & Floskeln | 421 | *Moin, Deutsch! Band II — Sätze & Floskeln* (everyday phrases, 23 chapters: greetings, small talk, bakery, checkout, restaurant, trains, doctor, Amt, phone, work, housing, occasions, Norddeutsch) |
| Grundwortschatz | 600 | *Moin, Deutsch!* Band I word list (30 chapters: articles, pronouns, verbs, numbers, family, time, food, home, body, city, work, clothing, colors, weather & nature, particles, useful nouns/verbs, shopping). 54 entries that already exist in the other categories were left out to avoid duplicate cards; the question words, two separable verbs and the body-part nouns moved to their own categories |
| W-Wörter | 38 | all German question words: wer/wen/wem/wessen, the wie-combinations (wie viel(e), wie lange, wie oft, wie spät …), warum/wieso/weshalb/wozu, and every wo(r)-compound (womit, worauf, woran, worüber …) — each with an example sentence and a grammar note |
| Trennbare Verben | 16 | separable verbs (abfahren, anrufen, aufwachen, einsteigen, umziehen …) — every card's example sentence shows the prefix split, with English translation and a "trennbar: ich rufe … an" note |
| Körperteile | 21 | body parts (Kopf, Auge, Hand, Fuß, Herz …) with example sentences, translations and the plural form as the tip (die Hände, die Füße, die Zähne …) |

### Notes on the *Sätze & Floskeln* cards

Each card's note keeps the extra context from the book:

- **hören** — a phrase the street says *to you* (cashier, conductor, loudspeaker)
- **sagen** — your line
- no tag — flows both ways
- **Norddeutsch** — Bremen/Hamburg specials

## Project structure

```
index.html            the whole app (UI, styles, data packs, logic)
api/ai.js             Vercel serverless proxy for the AI features
manifest.webmanifest  PWA manifest
sw.js                 service worker (offline cache)
icons/                favicon + home-screen icons
```

Study keyboard shortcuts: `Space` flips the card, `1`–`4` = Nochmal / Schwer / Gut / Leicht, `←` = Nochmal, `→` = Gut.
