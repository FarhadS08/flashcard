# Wortschatz — Moin, Deutsch!

A German flashcard app: single page, no build step, installable on your phone, works offline.



## Use it everywhere

- **Install as an app**: the site is a PWA — on Android/Chrome use *Add to Home Screen / Install*,
  on iOS Safari use *Share → Add to Home Screen*. It launches standalone with its own icon.
- **Offline**: a service worker caches the app; your words are stored in `localStorage` on the device.
- **Responsive**: layouts for small phones (320 px+), notched screens (safe areas), landscape, tablet and desktop.

> Words are stored in the browser (localStorage) and can additionally sync between devices with an account — see below.

## Accounts & sync

The app has built-in accounts ("Konto & Sync" via the cloud button in the header): register once, log in on each device, and your words plus the full learning progress sync automatically — the deck is pulled when the app opens and pushed ~1.5 s after every change; the newest state wins.

You stay logged in via a secure (`HttpOnly`) session cookie that renews itself for 90 days on every visit — even if the browser clears local storage, the app logs itself back in and restores the deck from the server.

## Features

- **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — the Anki-style algorithm: four grades (Nochmal / Schwer / Gut / Leicht) with the projected interval shown on each button, learning steps for new cards (1/10 min), growing review intervals (interval × per-card ease factor, with fuzz), and lapse handling (failed reviews drop into relearning with a reduced interval and ease). Decks from the previous Leitner version migrate automatically with progress preserved
- **Topics** — toggle categories on/off with the chips above the card deck
- **Rounds ("Pro Runde")** — practice in chunks of 5 / 10 / 15 / 25 cards instead of everything at once; the done screen shows how many cards are still due and starts the next chunk
- **Smart round composition ("Modus")** — rounds are dealt deterministically, not randomly: overdue reviews first, then cards in learning, then new words in book order; words you finished this sitting don't repeat in the next rounds; the counter shows the mix ("3 fällig + 7 neu"); switch the mode to Mix / Neue / Fällige
- **Learn state for new words** — cards you have never studied are presented first (word, translation, example and note all visible) before they get quizzed later in the same round; "Kenn ich schon" skips a known word straight to a 4-day interval
- **Repeat & drill** — "Diese Runde wiederholen" runs the same words again as an ungraded practice round (your schedule stays untouched); in the word list, "Auswählen" lets you hand-pick any words and start them as a real learning round or a drill
- **Unlimited words** — add your own words in the *+ Neu* tab
- **AI assist** — type just the German word and the AI fills in the article, translation, example sentence (with English translation) and a grammar note
- **Example translations** — cards with an example sentence show its English translation right below it
- **Search & edit** — full word list with search, inline edit and delete

## Built-in categories

| Category | Cards | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Meine Wörter | 9 | starter words |
| Adjektive | 16 | common adjectives |
| Präpositionen | 14 | prepositions with case notes |
| Sätze & Floskeln | 421 | *Moin, Deutsch! Band II — Sätze & Floskeln* (everyday phrases, 23 chapters: greetings, small talk, bakery, checkout, restaurant, trains, doctor, Amt, phone, work, housing, occasions, Norddeutsch) |
| Grundwortschatz | 621 | *Moin, Deutsch!* Band I word list (30 chapters: articles, pronouns, verbs, numbers, family, time, food, home, body, city, work, clothing, colors, weather & nature, particles, useful nouns/verbs, shopping). 54 entries that already exist in the other categories were left out to avoid duplicate cards; the question words and two separable verbs moved to their own categories |
| W-Wörter | 38 | all German question words: wer/wen/wem/wessen, the wie-combinations (wie viel(e), wie lange, wie oft, wie spät …), warum/wieso/weshalb/wozu, and every wo(r)-compound (womit, worauf, woran, worüber …) — each with an example sentence and a grammar note |
| Trennbare Verben | 16 | separable verbs (abfahren, anrufen, aufwachen, einsteigen, umziehen …) — every card's example sentence shows the prefix split, with English translation and a "trennbar: ich rufe … an" note |

### Notes on the *Sätze & Floskeln* cards

Each card's note keeps the extra context from the book:

- **hören** — a phrase the street says *to you* (cashier, conductor, loudspeaker)
- **sagen** — your line
- no tag — flows both ways
- **Norddeutsch** — Bremen/Hamburg specials

## Project structure

```
index.html            the whole app (UI, styles, data packs, logic)
api/ai.js             Vercel serverless proxy for the AI features
manifest.webmanifest  PWA manifest
sw.js                 service worker (offline cache)
icons/                favicon + home-screen icons
```

Study keyboard shortcuts: `Space` flips the card, `1`–`4` = Nochmal / Schwer / Gut / Leicht, `←` = Nochmal, `→` = Gut.
